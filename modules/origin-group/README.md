## Required Inputs

The following input variables are required:

### <a name="input_load_balancing_settings"></a> [load\_balancing\_settings](#input\_load\_balancing\_settings)

Description: Load balancing configuration for distributing traffic across origins within this origin group.

These settings determine how Azure Front Door distributes requests among healthy origins and how it evaluates origin health for load balancing decisions.

- `additional_latency_in_milliseconds` = (Required) Additional latency in milliseconds for probes to fall into the lowest latency bucket. Range: 0-1000.
- `sample_size`                        = (Required) Number of samples to consider for load balancing decisions. Range: 1-255.
- `successful_samples_required`        = (Required) Number of successful samples required to mark an origin as healthy. Range: 1-255.

Example Input:

```hcl
load_balancing_settings = {
  additional_latency_in_milliseconds = 50
  sample_size                        = 4
  successful_samples_required        = 3
}
```

Type:

```hcl
object({
    additional_latency_in_milliseconds = number
    sample_size                        = number
    successful_samples_required        = number
  })
```

### <a name="input_name"></a> [name](#input\_name)

Description: The name of the origin group resource.

This name uniquely identifies the origin group within the CDN profile and is used when referencing the origin group in routes and other configurations.

```

Type: `string`

### <a name="input_profile_id"></a> [profile\_id](#input\_profile\_id)

Description: The full Azure Resource ID of the CDN profile where this origin group will be created.

Example Input:

```hcl
profile_id = "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/my-rg/providers/Microsoft.Cdn/profiles/my-profile"
```

Type: `string`

### <a name="input_profile_name"></a> [profile\_name](#input\_profile\_name)

Description: The name of the parent CDN profile.

This is used to construct resource references and must match the name in the `profile_id`.

Example Input:

```hcl

Type: `string`

## Optional Inputs

The following input variables are optional (have default values):

### <a name="input_authentication"></a> [authentication](#input\_authentication)

When enabled, requests from the same client will be routed to the same origin server, which is useful for stateful applications.

Possible values:
- `Enabled` - Route requests from the same client to the same origin

This gradual restoration prevents overwhelming a newly healthy or new origin with traffic immediately. Traffic is incrementally increased over this time period.

Constraints:
- Range: 0-50 minutes
- Default: 10 minutes
- Set to 0 to immediately restore full traffic

Example Input:

```hcl
